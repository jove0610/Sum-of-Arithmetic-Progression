An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members is a constant.

The program calculates the sum of all the sequence of numbers in an arithmetic progression given that you have:

1. The first digit
2. The number of digits
3. The common difference between any two successive numbers


Example:
1. Get the sum of 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 20.

-In the above example the first digit is 2 and the number of digits is 7 while the common difference is 3.
